# 📖 Console-based Contact Book App 📱

*This project is part of a comprehensive 14-week Programming Fundamentals (PF) course, involving assignments and weekly labs.*

As an assignment project, this **Console-based Contact Book Application** demonstrates key PF concepts in action.

The Contact Book App efficiently manages contact information, allowing users to **add**, **search**, **update**, and **delete** contact records. The project utilizes a wide range of core Programming Fundamentals, including:

---

### 🚀 Key Concepts Covered:

- 🔢 **Variables and Data Types:** For storing contact details like names, phone numbers, and addresses.
- ➕ **Arithmetic Operators:** Used for logical operations within the program.
- 🔁 **Loops and Conditional Statements:** To iterate over contact records and manage user input.
- 🛠️ **Functions:** For modularizing the code and making it easy to maintain.
- 🧭 **Pointers and References:** For managing memory dynamically and passing data efficiently between functions.
- ⚖️ **Dynamic and Static Typing:** Implemented in variable management for more flexible and efficient code.
- 📝 **Comments:** To ensure code clarity and understanding.

---

The project consists of two main files:

1. 🗂️ The first file utilizes **`fstream`** for file handling operations.
2. 🔀 The second file demonstrates the simple use of **dynamic arrays** and **pointers** for efficient memory management.

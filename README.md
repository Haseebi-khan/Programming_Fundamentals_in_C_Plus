# 📖 Console-based Contact Book App 📱

This project is a part of a comprehensive 14-week **Programming Fundamentals (PF)** course, combining theoretical assignments and weekly practical labs.

The **Contact Book App** serves as a practical demonstration of key programming concepts, showcasing efficient management of contact information. It enables users to perform essential operations such as:

- **Adding contacts**
- **Searching for contacts**
- **Updating contact details**
- **Deleting contact records**

---

## 🚀 Key Programming Concepts Covered

This project integrates several fundamental programming principles:

- **🔢 Variables and Data Types**  
  Used for storing and managing contact details such as names, phone numbers, and addresses.

- **➕ Arithmetic Operators**  
  Applied in logical operations to support program functionality.

- **🔁 Loops and Conditional Statements**  
  Essential for iterating over contact records and managing user input dynamically.

- **🛠️ Functions**  
  Code modularity is achieved through functions, improving readability, scalability, and maintenance.

- **🧭 Pointers and References**  
  Dynamic memory management is implemented using pointers and references, ensuring efficiency.

- **⚖️ Dynamic and Static Typing**  
  Effective handling of variable types enables both flexibility and optimization.

- **📝 Comments**  
  Comprehensive in-code documentation ensures clarity and ease of understanding for future developers.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The **Contact Book App** consists of two main files:

1. **File 1:**  
   - Incorporates `fstream` for file handling operations.  
   - Manages persistent storage of contact information.

2. **File 2:**  
   - Demonstrates the use of dynamic arrays and pointers.  
   - Ensures efficient memory management for runtime operations.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I:

- Gain hands-on experience with **file handling**, **dynamic memory management**, and **modular coding**.
- Develop a strong understanding of programming fundamentals by applying them to a practical use case.
- Learn the importance of clear code documentation and structured project organization.
